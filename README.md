# Opioids Dashboard
Opioids have gotten a lot of attention in the last several years. Someone dies from an accidental drug overdose every 8 minutes in the United States, [according to a recent report from CNN.](https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2018/12/11/opioids-addiction-overdose-orig-nws.cnn) Most of the time, the drug that causes the overdose is an opioid such as [fentanyl.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/health/drugs-overdose-fentanyl-study/index.html) Even though the majority of patients are getting access to opioids legally through their primary care physician to manage chronic pain or through a specialist following a surgical procedure, a lot of attention has been has been put on prescribing habits.

This Shiny application, written in R, was developed to give an overview of these prescribing habits per state from 2013-2016. Users can drill into particular years, states, and specialties to return a list of providers and their respective prescription rates, which is defined here as the ratio of opioid claims to total claims.

The data used here is from the [Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://data.cms.gov/browse?q=Medicare%20Provider%20Utilization%20and%20Payment%20Data%3A%20Part%20D%20Prescriber%20Summary%20Table%20CY2014&sortBy=relevance) for the years 2013-2016. Each file is a list of physicians who see Medicare Part D beneficiaries, with variables such as demographics, total claim counts, opioid claim counts, number of 30 day fills, and opioid prescription rates, among others.
